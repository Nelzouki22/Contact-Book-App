create a Contact Book Application in C++ where you can get to grips with advanced data handling, such as storing, editing, searching, and deleting contact information
Code Explanation:

How did you find that C++ project? Letâ€™s break down the main parts of this program of this address book app:

We defined a Contact struct to store the name, phone, and email of each contact.
The addContact function allows users to add a new contact to the contact book.
The displayContacts function lists all contacts in the contact book.
The searchContact function looks for a contact by name and displays it if found.
The deleteContact removes a contact from the list based on the name.
The main function provides a simple menu for the user to choose between adding a new contact, displaying contacts, searching for a contact, deleting a contact, or exiting the program.
We use a vector of Contact structs to store the list of contacts.
When you run this program, the user has the option to add new contacts, view the current contacts in their contact book, search for contacts, or delete contacts.
